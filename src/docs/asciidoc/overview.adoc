WARNING: Hey! Fix all Bastion requests without descriptive text!

Bastion is a Java-based library for testing HTTP APIs and endpoints. Developers can use Bastion to test any type of HTTP service
but the library also provides built-in classes for testing endpoints validating responses containing various different content types including
JSON and Form URL encoded data.

This reference manual explains all the features of the Bastion library and how to use them. For a more detailed description of
the Bastion API, please see the http://bastion.rocks/javadocs/index.html[Bastion JavaDocs].

---------------------------------------

Quickstart
----------

Bastion makes it very easy to write simple API tests. Let us look at a test for an API which returns JSON.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
@RunWith(BastionRunner.class)
public class VatValidatorTest {
    @Test
    public void callValidateVatNumber_returnsAmazonVatData() {
        Bastion.request("Validate Amazon's VAT Number", GeneralRequest.get("http://vatlayer.com/php_helper_scripts/vat_api.php")
                .addQueryParam("secret_key", "577b6fb6551df7f3532ecbd45ea07ddd")
                .addQueryParam("vat_number", "LU26375245")
        ).withAssertions(JsonResponseAssertions.fromResource(200, "classpath:/json/amazon_vat.json")).call();
    }
}
--------------------------------------------

In this test, we make a simple +GET+ request on the URL +http://vatlayer.com/php_helper_scripts/vat_api.php+. We add two query parameters
to the request namely, +secret_key+ and +vat_number+. We then expect a JSON response using a +JsonResponseAssertions+ object. This assertions
object will check that the status code is +200+ (as specified by the user), and that the content-type header returned is indeed +application/json+.
It will also check that the returned JSON content matches that found in the +json/amazon_vat.json+ file.

Notice that this JSON comparison is not a straight-up text equality comparison: instead, it structurally compares the actual received JSON to
the expected JSON as if they were objects. Changing the order of properties in the response won't matter. Even better, say the test fails, Bastion
will tell you exactly what operations you need to perform to the response to get the expected outcome. Here is an example of an error output when
the +JsonResponseAssertions+ fail:

--------------------------------------------
java.lang.AssertionError: Actual response body is not as expected. The following JSON Patch (as per RFC-6902) tells you what
operations you need to perform to transform the actual response body into the expected response body:
  [{"op":"replace","path":"/country_code","value":"MT"}]
--------------------------------------------

We can see how the error tells us to change the value in the +/country_code+ property to +MT+.

This is only a taste of what Bastion can do. In the rest of the sections in this user guide, we explain all the features
of Bastion and how you can even extend the library to create your own requests and assertions depending on your domain.

Overview
--------

Bastion tests are implemented using the +Bastion+ builder. This class provides a fluent-like interface for specifying tests. In the code snippet
below, we show how all the methods of the builder would look like when executed together.

---------------------------
Bastion.request(...)        <1>
       .bind(...)           <2>
       .withAssertions(...) <3>
       .thenDo(...)         <4>
       .call()              <5>
       .getModel()          <6>
---------------------------

IMPORTANT: This shows the basic structure of a Bastion test. Each one of the methods listed above (except +request()+ and +call()+) is optional but they still
must be specified in the order above. If you chose to skip +withAssertions()+, for example, you must call +bind()+ before +call()+. The list below
explains each one of these methods separately.

<1> +request()+: This method is the main entry-point to create a Bastion test. You must specify a name which will identify this test in test reports
and also provide a _request_ object that tells Bastion what kind of HTTP request to send. Bastion provides a number of different
built-in requests you can use (eg. +JsonRequest+) but you can also implement your own request types. For a list of all built-in requests see
[Requests](#requests). The [Custom Requests](#custom-requests) section explains how to implement your own requests.
<2> +bind()+: Tells Bastion which model class to use when interpreting the incoming HTTP entity. When Bastion receives a response from the remote
server, it will decode the received entity data into an object of the given type. If this decoding process fails for some reason,
the entire test is marked as failed. By providing a model class using the +bind()+ method, you'll have this type information available
for later on when calling the +withAssertions()+, +thenDo()+, +getModel()+ and +getResponse().getModel()+ methods.
<3> +withAssertions()+: Takes an _assertions_ object which will verify that the response returned by the remote server is correct.
Bastion provides a number of different built-in assertion objects for common verifications you might want to do (eg. +JsonResponseAssertions+) but you can also
implement your own assertions. For a list of all built-in assertions see [Assertions](#assertions). The
[Custom Assertions](#custom-assertions) section explains how to implement your own assertions.
<4> +thenDo()+: Takes a _Callback_ object which will be executed when the response is received and the assertions pass. This is useful if you would
like to perform specific actions after Bastion requests. This could be logging the response, for example, or saving authentication data for future
Bastion requests.
<5> +call()+: Executes the API request configured with the previous commands. Any assertions will be applied on the received response. The call operation
will fail if Bastion is unable to bind the received response to a model or the assertions fail.
<6> +getResponse()+: After the +call()+ method is executed, you can get the HTTP response object received using the +getResponse()+ method. The returned
response object will contain the bound model obtained from the response data.
<6> +getModel()+: After the +call()+ method is executed, you can get the bound model obtained from the response data.

Requests
--------

_Request_ objects are passed to the +request()+ method which is the first builder method invoked when using the +Bastion+ builder. A +Request+ object
defines the HTTP data that is sent to the remote server while the test is executing. We suggest using one of the built-in +Request+ subclasses when
supplying your request data. Alternatively, if none of the built-in request subclasses are useful, you can create your own +Request+ subclass
as explained in the section <<custom-requests>>

.Built-in request classes
Bastion provides the following list of built-in +Request+ subclasses:

* <<general-request, GeneralRequest>>: A simple HTTP request which allows for any arbitrary entity data.
* <<json-request,JsonRequest>>: An HTTP request which takes a JSON string as its entity data.
* <<form-url-encoded-request,FormUrlEncodedRequest>>: An HTTP request which takes data in the form of a map which is then sent as a URL encoded string
as if the data was submitted using an HTML form.

[[request-attributes]]
.Adding request attributes
Any +Request+ supports the following attributes, some of which are standard to HTTP:

* *Headers*: Use the +addHeader()+ method to add a header to a request.
* *Query Parameters*: Use the +addQueryParam()+ method to add a query parameter to a request.
* *Route Parameters*: Use the +addRouteParam()+ method to add a route parameter value to a request. Route parameters are placeholder variables
(delimited using a pair of braces) in the request's URL which are then replaced by values which you specify using the +addRouteParam()+ method.
The following is an example of a URL with route parameters:
-----
http://reddit.com/r/{subreddit}
-----
* *Content Type*:
* *Entity Body*:

[[general-request]]
General Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+GeneralRequest+ is the universal HTTP request, able to take any arbitrary entity data string. To initialise a new +GeneralRequest+ use any of the following
static factory methods, giving the URL you want to send the request on:

* +GeneralRequest.get()+: Initialise an HTTP +GET+ request.
* +GeneralRequest.post()+: Initialise an HTTP +post()+ request. This method also takes a string to use as the HTTP entity data (use +GeneralRequest.EMPTY_BODY+ to send no data).
* +GeneralRequest.delete()+: Initialise an HTTP +delete()+ request. This method also takes a string to use as the HTTP entity data (use +GeneralRequest.EMPTY_BODY+ to send no data).
* +GeneralRequest.put()+: Initialise an HTTP +put()+ request. This method also takes a string to use as the HTTP entity data (use +GeneralRequest.EMPTY_BODY+ to send no data).
* +GeneralRequest.patch()+: Initialise an HTTP +patch()+ request. This method also takes a string to use as the HTTP entity data (use +GeneralRequest.EMPTY_BODY+ to send no data).

Calling any of the above methods will give you an initialised +GeneralRequest+ object which can be used with +Bastion.request()+. The request will not initially
have any HTTP headers, query parameters or route parameters.

Once you have an instance of +GeneralRequest+, you can call methods to modify *Headers*, *Query Parameters*, *Route Parameters* and *Content type* as
explained in section <<request-attributes>>.

[source,java]
-----
Bastion.request("Get Sushi",
    GeneralRequest.get("http://sushi.test/sushi/5")
).call();
-----

[[json-request]]
JSON Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+JsonRequest+ is a request object specially designed to handle JSON data. Unlike +GeneralRequest+, +JsonRequest+ will set the appropriate content type header
to indicate that the data being sent has mime-type +application/json+. The request object is initialised using a JSON string (or file) and will validate the
given data to ensure that it is valid JSON (if you don't want this validation, use +GeneralRequest+ instead). To initialise a new +JsonRequest+ use any of the
following static factory methods, giving the URL you want to send the request on:

* +JsonRequest.fromString()+: Allows you to create a +JsonRequest+ with the given HTTP method (+GET+, +POST+, etc.) and the given JSON string.
* +JsonRequest.fromResource()+: Allows you to create a +JsonRequest+ with the given HTTP method. The JSON data to send is loaded from the given file or classpath resource.
* +JsonRequest.fromTemplate()+: Like +fromResource()+ but this method will also take a map of template variable names to replacement values as keys and a Mustache template file. The template data is loaded and the variables replaced by the values in the given map. The resulting data is then used as the JSON entity for the request.

WARNING: The request object here will *validate* that the provided data is valid JSON, in all cases. If you want to send invalid JSON, see <<general-request>> instead.

The factory methods above also have utility methods which do not take an +HttpMethod+ argument as follows:

* +JsonRequest.postFromString()+
* +JsonRequest.postFromResource()+
* +JsonRequest.postfromTemplate()+
* +JsonRequest.putFromString()+
* +JsonRequest.putFromResource()+
* ... and so on.

Once you have an instance of +JsonRequest+, you can call methods to modify *Headers*, *Query Parameters* and *Route Parameters* as
explained in section <<request-attributes>>. You can also change the *Content type* header that is sent using +overrideContentType()+.

.JSON request from a string

Use the +fromString()+ family of static factory methods to directly supply the JSON data to use in the test. You can simply type in
your JSON request, as you would using an HTTP client, and Bastion will take care of all the other details related to JSON requests
for you.

[source,java]
-----
Bastion.request(JsonRequest.putFromString("http://test.test",
    "{ \"key\":\"value\", \"array\":[ \"1\", \"test\" ] }")
).call();
-----

TIP: In a language like Java, typing the request data directly in the test can quickly start becoming unwieldy due to all
the extra escape characters you need. We recommend using a language like Groovy, which supports multi-line strings, allowing
you to avoid all the unnecessary escape characters.

.JSON request from a file

Use the +fromResource()+ family of static factory methods to load a simple JSON file as the HTTP entity body. The +fromResource()+
methods can take any URL including those beginning with the +classpath:+ prefix (which loads a file from the
classpath).

[source,java]
-----
Bastion.request(JsonRequest.postFromResource("http://localhost:8080/login",
    "classpath:/fixtures/login-request.json")
).call();
-----

.JSON request from a template

The +fromTemplate()+ family of static factory methods are similar to +fromResource()+ but they also take any additional argument
containing a map where the keys are variable names and the values are the replacement values for the variable placeholders in the
template.

[source,java]
-----
Bastion.request(JsonRequest.postFromTemplate("http://awesomewebsite.test",
    "classpath:/rocks/bastion/core/request/test-template-body.json",
    Collections.singletonMap("food", "apples")
).call();
-----

The template files must be Mustache templates. An example Mustache template is shown below:

[source,javascript]
-----
{
  "name": "john",
  "timestamp": "2016-10-15T20:00:25+0100",
  "favourites": {
    "food": "{{ food }}",
    "colours": ["blue", "red"],
    "number": 23
  }
}
-----

Notice the +food+ variable in the template: this will get replaced by the value +apples+ in the test.

[[form-url-encoded-request]]
Form URL Encoded Data Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+FormUrlEncodedRequest+ is a request object that allows you send URL encoded data as part of the HTTP request. This request is equivalent to
requests sent by HTML forms (hence the +Form+ in the name). The request will automatically be configured to have the mime-type +application/x-www-form-urlencoded+.
Unlike +JsonRequest+, after initialising a +ForumUrlEncodedRequest+, you will need to call additional method to fill in the request's data.

First, use any of the following static factory methods and specify the URL to send the request to:

* +FormUrlEncodedRequest.post()+
* +FormUrlEncodedRequest.put()+
* +FormUrlEncodedRequest.delete()+
* +FormUrlEncodedRequest.patch()+
* +FormUrlEncodedRequest.withMethod()+

TIP: The +withMethod()+ factory method allows you choose any HTTP method you want (including +GET+). Use it when none of the
other standard factory methods are suitable for your test.

Once you have an instance of +FormUrlEncodedRequest+, you can call methods to modify *Headers*, *Query Parameters* and *Route Parameters* as
explained in section <<request-attributes>>. You can also change the *Content type* header that is sent using +overrideContentType()+.

More importantly, use the +addDataParameter()+ or +addDataParameters()+ methods to add the data
which will go into the request's entity body. The +FormUrlEncodedRequest+ will automatically format the data you supply, internally,
into a URL encoded string. An example, using +FormUrlEncodedRequest+ follows below,

[source,java]
-----
Bastion.request(FormUrlEncodedRequest.post("http://awesomewebsite.test/submit.php")
    .addDataParameter("name", "John Doe")
    .addDataParameter("country", "MT")
).call();
-----

[[custom-requests]]
Custom Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bastion gives you the option of developing your own request classes. This is useful if you notice that you are repeatedly
using a particular request in your tests. For the sake of maintainability and better software design, you can avoid repeatedly
initialising the same request, over and over again, by implementing your own request type.

The relevant interface to implement is +HttpRequest+. This interface defines the following methods which you need to implement:

* +name()+: Returns a descriptive name of the current request object. This name _might_ appear in test reports, so returning
a good name helps you debug faster when a problem occurs.
* +url()+: Returns the URL string which the request will be sent to. Bastion is quite lenient on what constitutes a valid URL.
If a question mark appears in the URL, for example, anything after the question mark will be added to the request's query parameters.
* +method()+: Returns the HTTP method that the request will be sent with. This could be +GET+, +POST+, +PUT+, etc.
* +contentType()+: Returns the value which will be used for the +Content-type+ HTTP header. You can are not required to return
a content type, hence this method returns an +Optional+ value.
* +headers()+: Returns the possibly empty +Collection+ of +ApiHeader+ objects (or rather, HTTP headers) which will be sent with the request.
* +queryParams()+: Returns the possibly empty +Collection+ of +ApiQueryParam+ objects which are sent with the HTTP request.
* +routeParams()+: Returns the values to use for filling in any route parameters in this request's URL. Route parameters are
variables, enclosed within a pair of braces, in the requet's URL.
* +body()+: Returns the object to use for the HTTP entity body. Bastion will typically send the returned object's +toString()+
value but this _might_ be depend on the request's content type.

Once you've implemented your own +HttpRequest+, you can then pass it, as if it was any other request, to the +Bastion.request()+
method.

TIP: If you've developed a general +HttpRequest+ which you think might be useful for the Bastion community and other users,
please consider submitting a pull request to the main Bastion repository. See the <<contribute>> section for more information.

Assertions
----------

_Assertions_ objects are passed to the +withAssertions()+ method which is called either after the +request()+ method or the +bind()+ method when using the
+Bastion+ builder. An +Assertions+ objects defines the test predicate applied on the received HTTP response. If any of the applied assertions fail, then
the test fails. Certain +Assertions+ objects will provide helpful messages and logs to explain how to transform the received response into the expected response.
When supplying +Assertions+ using the +withAssertions()+ method, you can use the +and()+ method on the Assertions themselves to chain +Assertions+ together.

We suggest using one of the built-in +Assertions+ subclasses when defining your tests. Alternatively, if none of the built-in assertions subclasses are
useful, you can create your own +Assertions+ subclass as explained in the section [Custom Assertions](#custom-assertions).

Bastion provides the following list of built-in +Assertions+ subclasses.

* [JsonResponseAssertions](#json-response-assertions): Asserts that a received response is in JSON format and that the received response data is as expected.
* [JsonSchemaAssertions](#json-schema-assertions): Asserts that a received response is in JSON format and that the received response data at least conforms to the given JSON schema.

or form, that help make Bastion better. Here are some things you can do to contribute:

* Send a positive comment to the Bastion contributers. :)
* [Submit an issue](https://github.com/KPull/Bastion/issues) on GitHub containing a bug report or suggestion. We ask you to spend a couple minutes before
  submitting an issue to check that it has not been submitted earlier. When opening an issue, try to include as much detail as possible so that the
  community can more easily address your concern.
* Submit a pull request for any of our [open issues](https://github.com/KPull/Bastion/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue). Some issues are more easy to implement
  than others and, if you're just starting out, these issues let you get used to the Bastion code structure. If you need any assistance, simply comment on
  the issue at hand and we'll be glad to help. We ask that you adhere to a consistent code style and employ good programming practice but don't worry if
  you're unsure about anything: we'll help you get your submission up to scratch as well.
* You can also [submit a pull request](https://github.com/KPull/Bastion/pulls) which is not related to any of the issues currently on GitHub. If you have
  developed your own +Request+ or +Assertions+ implementations, for example, and you believe they could be useful to the rest of the Bastion community,
  we will add them to the library for use in future versions of Bastion.
* Make our User Guide better. Our User Guide is very important to us and we strive to keep it as up to date as possible. If you spot any omissions, typos,
  grammatical errors or have an idea of how it can be improved, please submit a pull request. The files for our user guide can be found in the +src/docs/md+
  directory.
