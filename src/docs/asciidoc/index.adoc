Bastion is a Java-based library for testing HTTP APIs and endpoints. Developers can use Bastion to test any type of HTTP service
but the library also provides built-in classes for testing endpoints validating responses containing various different content types including
JSON and Form URL encoded data.

This reference manual explains all the features of the Bastion library and how to use them. For a more detailed description of
the Bastion API, please see the http://bastion.rocks/javadocs/index.html[Bastion JavaDocs].

Quickstart
----------

Bastion makes it very easy to write simple API tests. Let us look at a test for an API which returns JSON.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
[ex:quickstart]
--------------------------------------------

Overview
--------

Bastion tests are implemented using the `Bastion` builder. This class provides a fluent-like interface for specifying tests. In the code snippet
below, we show how all the methods of the builder would look like when executed together.

---------------------------
Bastion.request(...)        <1>
       .bind(...)           <2>
       .withAssertions(...) <3>
       .thenDo(...)         <4>
       .call()              <5>
       .getModel()          <6>
---------------------------

IMPORTANT: This shows the basic structure of a Bastion test. Each one of the methods listed above (except `request()` and `call()`) is optional but they still
must be specified in the order above. If you chose to skip `withAssertions()`, for example, you must call `bind()` before `call()`. The list below
explains each one of these methods separately.

<1> `request()`: This method is the main entry-point to create a Bastion test. You must specify a name which will identify this test in test reports
and also provide a _request_ object that tells Bastion what kind of HTTP request to send. Bastion provides a number of different
built-in requests you can use (eg. `JsonRequest`) but you can also implement your own request types. For a list of all built-in requests see
[Requests](#requests). The [Custom Requests](#custom-requests) section explains how to implement your own requests.
<2> `bind()`: Tells Bastion which model class to use when interpreting the incoming HTTP entity. When Bastion receives a response from the remote
server, it will decode the received entity data into an object of the given type. If this decoding process fails for some reason,
the entire test is marked as failed. By providing a model class using the `bind()` method, you'll have this type information available
for later on when calling the `withAssertions()`, `thenDo()`, `getModel()` and `getResponse().getModel()` methods.
<3> `withAssertions()`: Takes an _assertions_ object which will verify that the response returned by the remote server is correct.
Bastion provides a number of different built-in assertion objects for common verifications you might want to do (eg. `JsonResponseAssertions`) but you can also
implement your own assertions. For a list of all built-in assertions see [Assertions](#assertions). The
[Custom Assertions](#custom-assertions) section explains how to implement your own assertions.
<4> `thenDo()`: Takes a _Callback_ object which will be executed when the response is received and the assertions pass. This is useful if you would
like to perform specific actions after Bastion requests. This could be logging the response, for example, or saving authentication data for future
Bastion requests.
<5> `call()`: Executes the API request configured with the previous commands. Any assertions will be applied on the received response. The call operation
will fail if Bastion is unable to bind the received response to a model or the assertions fail.
<6> `getResponse()`: After the `call()` method is executed, you can get the HTTP response object received using the `getResponse()` method. The returned
response object will contain the bound model obtained from the response data.
<6> `getModel()`: After the `call()` method is executed, you can get the bound model obtained from the response data.

Requests
--------

_Request_ objects are passed to the `request()` method which is the first builder method invoked when using the `Bastion` builder. A `Request` object
defines the HTTP data that is sent to the remote server while the test is executing. We suggest using one of the built-in `Request` subclasses when
supplying your request data. Alternatively, if none of the built-in request subclasses are useful, you can create your own `Request` subclass
as explained in the section <<custom-requests>>

.Built-in request classes
Bastion provides the following list of built-in `Request` subclasses:

* <<general-request, GeneralRequest>>: A simple HTTP request which allows for any arbitrary entity data.
* <<json-request,JsonRequest>>: An HTTP request which takes a JSON string as its entity data.
* <<form-url-encoded-request,FormUrlEncodedRequest>>: An HTTP request which takes data in the form of a map which is then sent as a URL encoded string
as if the data was submitted using an HTML form.

[[request-attributes]]
.Adding request attributes

[[source,java]]
----
[ex:general-request-get-with-attributes]
----

Any `Request` supports the following attributes, some of which are standard to HTTP:

* *Headers*: Use the `addHeader()` method to add a header to a request.
* *Query Parameters*: Use the `addQueryParam()` method to add a query parameter to a request.
* *Route Parameters*: Use the `addRouteParam()` method to add a route parameter value to a request. Route parameters are placeholder variables
(delimited using a pair of braces) in the request's URL which are then replaced by values which you specify using the `addRouteParam()` method.
The following is an example of a URL with route parameters:
-----
http://reddit.com/r/{subreddit}
-----
* *Content Type*: The content type header describes the format for the data in the request's payload. The content type is expressed as a MIME
type string. The content type _may change_ how Bastion formats the request's entity type body. See the particular request's section in this user
guide for more information about how to set the content type.
* *Entity Body*: Contains the payload data that is sent with the request. Each different type of request defines its own way of accepting a body
object. `JsonRequest` for example accepts a file, JSON string or template and the accepted data will be sent as JSON in the request's body. You
need to see the specific request's type documentation for more information about how to provide the entity body data.

[[general-request]]
General Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`GeneralRequest` is the universal HTTP request, able to take any arbitrary entity data string. To initialise a new `GeneralRequest` use any of the following
static factory methods, giving the URL you want to send the request on:

* `GeneralRequest.get()`: Initialise an HTTP `GET` request.
* `GeneralRequest.post()`: Initialise an HTTP `post()` request. This method also takes a string to use as the HTTP entity data (use `GeneralRequest.EMPTY_BODY` to send no data).
* `GeneralRequest.delete()`: Initialise an HTTP `delete()` request. This method also takes a string to use as the HTTP entity data (use `GeneralRequest.EMPTY_BODY` to send no data).
* `GeneralRequest.put()`: Initialise an HTTP `put()` request. This method also takes a string to use as the HTTP entity data (use `GeneralRequest.EMPTY_BODY` to send no data).
* `GeneralRequest.patch()`: Initialise an HTTP `patch()` request. This method also takes a string to use as the HTTP entity data (use `GeneralRequest.EMPTY_BODY` to send no data).

Calling any of the above methods will give you an initialised `GeneralRequest` object which can be used with `Bastion.request()`. The request will not initially
have any HTTP headers, query parameters or route parameters.

Once you have an instance of `GeneralRequest`, you can call methods to modify *Headers*, *Query Parameters*, *Route Parameters* as
explained in section <<request-attributes>>.

TIP: By default, the `GeneralRequest` will have content type `text/plain`. Use `setContentType()` on the request to change the content type
to something else.

[[json-request]]
JSON Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`JsonRequest` is a request object specially designed to handle JSON data. Unlike `GeneralRequest`, `JsonRequest` will set the appropriate content type header
to indicate that the data being sent has mime-type `application/json`. The request object is initialised using a JSON string (or file) and will validate the
given data to ensure that it is valid JSON (if you don't want this validation, use `GeneralRequest` instead). To initialise a new `JsonRequest` use any of the
following static factory methods, giving the URL you want to send the request on:

* `JsonRequest.fromString()`: Allows you to create a `JsonRequest` with the given HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) and the given JSON string.
* `JsonRequest.fromResource()`: Allows you to create a `JsonRequest` with the given HTTP method. The JSON data to send is loaded from the given file or classpath resource.
* `JsonRequest.fromTemplate()`: Like `fromResource()` but this method will also take a map of template variable names to replacement values as keys and a Mustache template file. The template data is loaded and the variables replaced by the values in the given map. The resulting data is then used as the JSON entity for the request.

WARNING: The request object here will *validate* that the provided data is valid JSON, in all cases. If you want to send invalid JSON, see <<general-request>> instead.

The factory methods above also have utility methods which do not take an `HttpMethod` argument as follows:

* `JsonRequest.postFromString()`
* `JsonRequest.postFromResource()`
* `JsonRequest.postfromTemplate()`
* `JsonRequest.putFromString()`
* `JsonRequest.putFromResource()`
* ... and so on.

.JSON request from a string
[source,java]
-----
[ex:json-request-post-from-string]
-----

[source,java]
-----
[ex:json-request-patch-from-string]
-----

Use the `fromString()` family of static factory methods to directly supply the JSON data to use in the test. You can simply type in
your JSON request, as you would using an HTTP client, and Bastion will take care of all the other details related to JSON requests
for you.

TIP: In a language like Java, typing the request data directly in the test can quickly start becoming unwieldy due to all
the extra escape characters you need. We recommend using a language like Groovy, which supports multi-line strings, allowing
you to avoid all the unnecessary escape characters.

.JSON request from a file
[source,java]
-----
[ex:json-request-post-from-resource]
-----

Use the `fromResource()` family of static factory methods to load a simple JSON file as the HTTP entity body. The `fromResource()`
methods can take any URL including those beginning with the `classpath:` prefix (which loads a file from the
classpath).

.JSON request from a template

[source,java]
-----
[ex:json-request-post-from-template]
-----

The `fromTemplate()` family of static factory methods are similar to `fromResource()` but they also take any additional argument
containing a map where the keys are variable names and the values are the replacement values for the variable placeholders in the
template.

The template files must be Mustache templates. An example Mustache template is shown below:

[source,javascript]
-----
{
  "name": "john",
  "timestamp": "2016-10-15T20:00:25+0100",
  "favourites": {
    "food": "{{ food }}",
    "colours": ["blue", "red"],
    "number": 23
  }
}
-----

Notice the `food` variable in the template: this will get replaced by the value `apples` in the test above.

.JSON Request with Attributes

[source,javascript]
-----
[ex:json-request-post-from-resource-override]
-----

Once you have an instance of `JsonRequest`, you can call methods to modify *Headers*, *Query Parameters* and *Route Parameters* as
explained in section <<request-attributes, Request Attributes>>. You can also change the *Content type* header that is sent using `overrideContentType()`
(by default, `application/json` is sent).


[[form-url-encoded-request]]
Form URL Encoded Data Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`FormUrlEncodedRequest` is a request object that allows you send URL encoded data as part of the HTTP request. This request is equivalent to
requests sent by HTML forms (hence the `Form` in the name). The request will automatically be configured to have the mime-type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
Unlike `JsonRequest`, after initialising a `ForumUrlEncodedRequest`, you will need to call additional methods to fill in the request's data.

First, use any of the following static factory methods and specify the URL to send the request to:

* `FormUrlEncodedRequest.post()`
* `FormUrlEncodedRequest.put()`
* `FormUrlEncodedRequest.delete()`
* `FormUrlEncodedRequest.patch()`
* `FormUrlEncodedRequest.withMethod()`

TIP: The `withMethod()` factory method allows you choose any HTTP method you want (including `GET`). Use it when none of the
other standard factory methods are suitable for your test.

Use the `addDataParameter()` or `addDataParameters()` methods to add the data
which will go into the request's entity body. The `FormUrlEncodedRequest` will automatically format the data you supply, internally,
into a URL encoded string. An example, using `FormUrlEncodedRequest` follows below,

[source,java]
-----
[ex:form-url-encoded-request-post]
-----

.Form URL Encoded Request with Attributes

[source,java]
-----
[ex:form-url-encoded-request-put-override-content-type]
-----

Once you have an instance of `FormUrlEncodedRequest`, you can call methods to modify *Headers*, *Query Parameters* and *Route Parameters* as
explained in section <<request-attributes, Request Attributes>>. You can also change the *Content type* header that is sent using
`overrideContentType()` (by default, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is sent).

[[custom-requests]]
Custom Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bastion gives you the option of developing your own request classes. This is useful if you notice that you are repeatedly
using a particular request in your tests. For the sake of maintainability and better software design, you can avoid repeatedly
initialising the same request, over and over again, by implementing your own request type.

The relevant interface to implement is `HttpRequest`. This interface defines the following methods which you need to implement:

* `name()`: Returns a descriptive name of the current request object. This name _might_ appear in test reports, so returning
a good name helps you debug faster when a problem occurs.
* `url()`: Returns the URL string which the request will be sent to. Bastion is quite lenient on what constitutes a valid URL.
If a question mark appears in the URL, for example, anything after the question mark will be added to the request's query parameters.
* `method()`: Returns the HTTP method that the request will be sent with. This could be `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.
* `contentType()`: Returns the value which will be used for the `Content-type` HTTP header. You are not required to return
a content type, hence this method returns an `Optional` value.
* `headers()`: Returns the possibly empty `Collection` of `ApiHeader` objects (or rather, HTTP headers) which will be sent with the request.
* `queryParams()`: Returns the possibly empty `Collection` of `ApiQueryParam` objects which are sent with the HTTP request.
* `routeParams()`: Returns the values to use for filling in any route parameters in this request's URL. Route parameters are
variables, enclosed within a pair of braces, in the requet's URL.
* `body()`: Returns the object to use for the HTTP entity body. Bastion will typically send the returned object's `toString()`
value but this _might_ be depend on the request's content type.

Once you've implemented your own `HttpRequest`, you can then pass it, as if it was any other request, to the `Bastion.request()`
method.

The built-in `HttpRequest` implementations provided with Bastion are good examples. A simpler example is found in the test sources called
`CreateSushiRequest`.

TIP: If you've developed a `HttpRequest` implementation which you think might be useful for the Bastion community and other users,
please consider submitting a pull request to the main Bastion repository. See the <<contribute>> section for more information.

Assertions
----------

_Assertions_ objects are passed to the `withAssertions()` method which is called either after the `request()` method or the `bind()` method when using the
`Bastion` builder. An `Assertions` objects defines the test predicate applied on the received HTTP response. If any of the applied assertions fail, then
the test fails. Certain `Assertions` objects will provide helpful messages and logs to explain how to transform the received response into the expected response.
When supplying `Assertions` using the `withAssertions()` method, you can use the `and()` method on the Assertions themselves to chain `Assertions` together.

We suggest using one of the built-in `Assertions` subclasses when defining your tests. Alternatively, if none of the built-in assertions subclasses are
useful, you can create your own `Assertions` subclass as explained in the section <<custom-assertions>>.

Bastion provides the following list of built-in `Assertions` subclasses.

* <<json-assertions,JsonResponseAssertions>>: Asserts that a received response is in JSON format and that the received response data is as expected.
* <<json-schema,JsonSchemaAssertions>>: Asserts that a received response is in JSON format and that the received response data at least conforms to the given JSON schema.
* <<status-code-assertions,StatusCodeAssertions>>: Asserts that a received response has any of the expected HTTP status codes.

[[json-assertions]]
JSON Assertion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`JsonResponseAssertions` lets you test that specific JSON data has been received. The expected JSON data
can be given as a JSON string, loading from a file or loaded and compiled from a template file.

It is important to realise that when comparing the expected JSON with the actual JSON received in the response, Bastion will be smart enough
to ignore any trivial differences in the data. In particular, JSON is compared structurally as opposed to a straight-up string equality check.
Properties (not array values!) may be in a different order and there might be whitespace in the received data, but unless the JSON structure
is different, the test will pass.

First, you must initialise a `JsonResponseAssertions` object using one of the three static factory methods:

* `JsonResponseAssertions.fromString()`: Allows you to create a `JsonResponseAssertions` expecting the given HTTP status code and the given
JSON.
* `JsonResponseAssertions.fromResource()`: Allows you to create a `JsonResponseAssertions` expecting the given HTTP status code. The JSON data to assert for is loaded from the given file or classpath resource.
* `JsonResponseAssertions.fromTemplate()`: Like `fromResource()` but this method will also take a map of template variable names to replacement values as keys and a Mustache template file. The template data is loaded and the variables replaced by the values in the given map.
The resulting data is then used as the expected JSON entity for the assertions.

WARNING: The assertions object here will *validate* that the provided expected JSON is valid.

[ex:json-response-assertions-from-resource]

.JSON Response Assertions Failure

`JsonResponseAssertions` give some very useful insight into what your API under test is doing wrong. For example, the following test has been
set up to fail.

[source,java]
----
[ex:json-response-assertions-wrong-value]
----

Since the expected and actual JSON is compared structurally, Bastion outputs a JSON patch which describes exactly how to transform the actual
JSON into the received JSON. For the test above, for example, we get:

[source]
----
java.lang.AssertionError: Actual response body is not as expected.
The following JSON Patch (as per RFC-6902) tells you what operations you need to perform to transform the actual response body into the expected response body:
    [{"op":"replace","path":"/price","value":"EUR 5.60"}]
----

For the above test to pass, we need to replace the _value_ of the `price` property in the API with the value `EUR 5.60`.

.Additional operations on JsonResponseAssertions
Once you have a `JsonResponseAssertions` object, you can call the following methods on it, which will change the behaviour of the assertions
Bastion performs:

* `overrideContentType()`: Changes the expected content type header of the response. By default, Bastion will check that the content type
is `application/json` for the assertions to pass. You can change it using this method, if you need to.
* `ignoreValuesForProperties()`: Ignores the value returned in the response for the specified JSON properties. This is useful if you have an
auto-generated ID in the response, for example. Bastion will still check that the property appears in the response but will ignore any
difference in its value.

[source,java]
-----
[ex:json-response-assertions-ignore-field]
-----

[[json-schema-assertions]]
JSON Schema Assertion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This assertions object is similar to <<json-assertions,JsonResponseAssertions>> but takes a JSON schema as its input. The assertions object
will check that the received response conforms to the given JSON schema. This is useful when you do not care about the actual content of the
response (or perhaps you don't know what it will be yet) but do care that it is always in a consistent format.

First, you must initialise a `JsonSchemaAssertions` object using one of the two static factory methods:

* `JsonSchemaAssertions.fromString()`: Allows you to create a `JsonSchemaAssertions` where the schema to test for is supplied as a string
argument to this method.
* `JsonSchemaAssertions.fromResource()`: Allows you to create a `JsonSchemaAssertions` where the schema to test for is loaded from the given file or classpath resource.

TIP: Just like `JsonResponseAssertions`, this assertions object supports calling `overrideContentType()` to change
 the expected content-type header.

.JSON Schema Assertions loaded from String
[source,java]
----
[ex:json-schema-assertions-from-string]
----

TIP: As you can see from the example above, JSON Schema quickly becomes very unwieldy to type out in a Java source file. We strongly
recommend supplying the schema from an external resource or, if you really must type out the schema as a string, use an alternative
JVM language which supports multiline strings (like Groovy).

[[status-code-assertions]]
Status Code Assertions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple assertions object which asserts that the HTTP status code of the response is as expected. You can supply multiple expected
status codes and the assertion will pass if the status code matches any of the given expected status codes.

To instantiate a `StatusCodeAssertions` object use the `StatusCodeAssertions.expecting()` static factory method. The static factory method
takes any number of HTTP status codes which will all be considered as valid response codes.

.Multiple Status Code Assertions

[source,java]

[ex:status-code-assertions-multiple-args]

[[custom-assertions]]
Custom Assertions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bastion gives you the option of developing your own assertions classes. This is useful if you notice that you are repeatedly
using a particular assertion in your tests. For the sake of maintainability and better software design, you can avoid repeatedly
initialising the same assertions, over and over again, by implementing your own assertions type.

The relevant interface to implement is `Assertions`. This interface defines a single method which you need to implement: `execute()`.
The `execute()` method takes the following parameters, which Bastion will provider when the test runs:

* `statusCode`: The HTTP status code of the response.
* `response` (type: `ModelResponse`): The response object which represents the received response. This object will also contain
the object that Bastion has <<model-binding,bound>> from the response.
* `model`: The object that Bastion has <<model-binding,bound>> from the response. This is provided for convenience so that you don't need to
use `response.getModel()` every time.

Notice that `Assertions` takes a generic type parameter. This type parameter describes the type of response model that the `Assertions` object is
expecting. By supplying a good generic type argument in your `Assertions` subclass, the user will always have to `bind()` that model type before
using your `Assertions` object (see <<model-binding>> section).

Once you've implemented your own `Assertions`, you can then pass it, as if it was any other assertions object, to the `withAssertions()`
method.

The built-in `Assertions` implementations provided with Bastion are good examples.

TIP: If you've developed an `Assertions` implementation which you think might be useful for the Bastion community and other users,
please consider submitting a pull request to the main Bastion repository. See the <<contribute>> section for more information.

[[lambda-assertions]]
Lambda Assertions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the `Assertions` interface explained in <<custom-assertions,Custom Assertions>> contains only one method, it is a functional interface
which you can implement using a lambda as shown in the next example (the example below contains AssertJ assertions):

[source,java]
-----
[ex:lambda-assertions]
-----

[[model-binding]]
Binding a Model
---------------

Most of the time, you will want to extract the data received in an HTTP response, during a test, as a Java object. This lets you more easily
perform assertions on the Java object itself or perhaps even use the information contained within for a future request inside the same test.

The process for extracting a Java object from the HTTP response data is called *Binding a Model* and is achieved by using the `bind()` method
after calling `Bastion.request()`. `bind()` takes a Java class type which you'd like to extract.

For example, if the received data is a JSON-formatted string, you can extract a Java object representation of the JSON data by supplying the
Java type which corresponds to whatever JSON you're expecting.

.Bound model in assertions

Once you have bound a model type using `bind()`, the typed model object is available to whatever `Assertions` object you passed to the
`withAssertions()` method.This is particularly useful if you supply a lambda expression to the `withAssertions()` method as the model object
will be correctly typed and all the data will be directly available in Java.

*Example showing lambda expression goes here*

.Binding JSON data to Java Objects
When receiving `application/json` data, if you supply any Java object type to the `bind()` method, Bastion will use the Jackson library to
deserialise the received JSON data to whatever object type you supplied. This means that you can modify the way data is deserialised in your
data class using https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations/wiki/Jackson-Annotations[Jackson Annotations].

*Example binding JSON to Java object goes here*

Executing and Getting Data
--------------------------

Once you have configured a request and an assertions object for Bastion to execute, you can start the test using the `call()` method. Bastion
will execute the request supplied in `request()`, bind the response to a model of the type specified in `bind()` and finally assert that the assertions
given in `withAssertions()` hold true.

Once executed, you can retrieve the response data as follows:

* `getResponse()`: Returns a complete HTTP `Response` object containing all HTTP headers and the content body. It will also contain the
model object which was bound by Bastion.
* `getModel()`: Returns the model object which was bound by Bastion. This is a shortcut method for `getResponse().getModel()`.

*Examples showing both methods go here*

Global Configuration
