 * Defines the operations which a user can perform on a Bastion builder before any {@link Assertions assertions} object is added to the test.
 * At this point, a user may perform one of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #withAssertions(Assertions)}: Specify what test assertions to apply to the response. We recommend supplying the
 * assertions as a lambda or using one of the available subclass implementations of {@link Assertions}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #thenDo(Callback)}: Specify a callback function to execute when the response is received and it passes its assertions. We
 * recommend supplying the {@link Callback} as a lambda function.</li>
 * <li>{@link #call()}: Starts the Bastion test by executing the HTTP request.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * After using the {@linkplain #call()} method, the user may obtain the response, for further use in the ongoing test, using
 * methods defined in the {@link PostExecutionBuilder} interface.
